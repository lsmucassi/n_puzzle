### History

> N-Puzzle is based on the AI-Search Java applet developed at RMIT University by Vic Ciesielski, James Harland and Peter McDonald.

# Overview
N-Puzzle is a program for learning about graph-based search algorithms.
This progam uses the 8-puzzle to visualise the behaviour of various graph-based search algorithms.
The 8-puzzle is an instance of the n-puzzle problem, where eight tiles are placed on a 3x3 grid.
The remaining un-tiled position is an empty space. Tiles adjacent to the empty space may be moved into that space.
The puzzle is solved by finding a sequence of moves that will transform the initial state into the given goal state.

An example initial state and goal state are given below:
```
Initial state:

  2 3 -
  4 5 1
  6 7 8
Goal state:

  2 5 3
  4 7 -
  6 8 1
```
N-Puzzle provides five algorithms that can be used to solve the problem:

* Breadth-first Search (BFS)
* Depth-first Search (DFS)
* Iterative Deepening DFS (ID-DFS)
* bGreedy Search
* bA* Search

Since Greedy Search and A* Search are informed search algorithms, three heuristic functions are also provided:

* Euclidean distance heuristic
* Manhattan distance heuristic
* Tiles-out heuristic
